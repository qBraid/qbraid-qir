# Contributing

Welcome! We're delighted that you're interested in contributing. Your help is essential for keeping the project great.

## Getting Started

Before you start working on a new feature or a fix, here's how you can contribute:

1. **Fork the repository**: Visit the GitHub page of our project and use the "Fork" button to create a copy of the project in your own GitHub account.
2. **Create a Development Branch**: After forking, clone the repository to your local machine and create a new branch for your development. Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as `feature-<feature-name>` or `bugfix-<bug-description>`.
3. **Commit Your Changes**: Make your changes in your development branch and commit them. Be sure to write clear, concise commit messages.
4. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
5. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the original project repository and click on "Pull Requests", then click the "New Pull Request" button

### Development install

```shell
git clone https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir.git
cd qbraid-qir
pip install -e '.[qasm3,cirq]'
```

## Pull requests

Before submitting a pull request (PR), ensure your contributions comply with the [Developer's Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/), confirming your right to submit the work under this project's license. Contributors are encouraged to [sign commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits), however, it is not required.

For code changes, please ensure that:
1. All new code includes corresponding unit tests and satisfies code coverage.
2. Docstrings are thorough and accurate for both new and updated features.
3. All integration tests, including docs and linters, are passing.
4. New functions and classes are annotated with Python type hints to support `py.typed`.

### Run tests

Workflow: [`main.yml`](.github/workflows/main.yml)

- [ ] All unit tests are passing
- [ ] New/modified code has corresponding unit tests and satisfies ``codecov`` checks.

Install pytest:

```shell
pip install qbraid pytest pytest-cov
```

Run unit tests:

```shell
pytest tests
```

Generate a coverage report and verify that project and diff ``codecov`` are both upheld:

```bash
pytest --cov=qbraid_qir --cov-report=term tests/
```

### Build docs

Workflow: [`docs.yml`](.github/workflows/docs.yml)

- [ ] Docs builds are passing.
- [ ] New/modified code has appropriate docstrings.
- [ ] Tree stubs are updated, if applicable.
- [ ] README and/or example notebooks are updated, if applicable.

Static docs pages (e.g. User Guide) are written using reStructuredText (reST), which is the default plaintext markup language used by [Sphinx](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html). It's pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it. If you're unfamiliar, [reStructuredText Primer](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#restructuredtext-primer) is a good place to start.

Use [Google Style Python Docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
to specify attributes, arguments, exceptions, returns, and other related info. The docstrings are compiled into HTML using Sphinx, so to add relative links, in-line markup, bulleted lists, code-blocks, or do other types of formatting inside of docstrings, use the `reST` syntax mentioned (linked) above.

Install sphinx and other docs requirements:

```shell
pip install -e '.[docs]'
```

Then, build docs with:

```shell
cd docs
make html
```

View docs in local browser window:

```shell
open build/html/index.html
```

### Code style

Workflow: [`format.yml`](.github/workflows/format.yml)

- [ ] Formatting/linters checks pass
- [ ] All files have appropriate licensing header

For code style, our project uses a combination of [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort), [pylint](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint),
and [black](https://github.com/psf/black). Specific configurations for these tools should be added to [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml).

Install linters:

```shell
pip install 'black[jupyter]' isort pylint
```

Run the following and make changes as needed to satisfy format checks:

```shell
black qbraid_qir tests examples
isort qbraid_qir tests
pylint qbraid_qir tests
```

Add licensing headers to all files:

```shell
python3 tools/verify_headers.py --fix
```
